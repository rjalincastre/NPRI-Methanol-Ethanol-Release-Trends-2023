# NPRI Analysis and Environmental Insights Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and extracting insights from NPRI (National Pollutant Release Inventory) data provided by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). The analysis is aimed at identifying trends, monitoring pollutants, and generating actionable recommendations for environmental sustainability and policy-making.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Addressed missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistencies in the NPRI dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Visualized pollutant trends across regions and industries.
  - Identified key contributors to pollutant emissions over time.
- **Advanced Analytics**:
  - Cluster analysis for identifying hotspots of pollution.
  - Correlation analysis to determine factors affecting pollutant levels.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Created user-friendly dashboards to allow stakeholders to explore data interactively.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn
- **Notebook Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Visualization Tools**: Tableau (optional integration)

## Results
### Key Insights:
- Identified major pollutants and industries contributing to environmental concerns.
- Highlighted regional trends in pollutant release.
- Derived actionable insights for policymakers to address key issues.

### Model Performance:
- Cluster analysis and pollutant forecasting achieved meaningful accuracy for decision-making.

## Future Improvements
- Integrate real-time NPRI updates for dynamic analysis.
- Expand the model to include additional environmental datasets (e.g., climate change or energy consumption data).
- Enhance dashboards for better interactivity and mobile responsiveness.
